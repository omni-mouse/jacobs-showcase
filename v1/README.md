# Version 1

This is the first iteration of Omni. The hardware consists of a removeable mouthpiece, microcontroller, bluetooth module, and battery. The downside of this design is that the mouthpiece is hard to take in and out of the mouth. This makes it inconvenient to use speech-to-text recognition for typing. We address this problem in the next iteration.
