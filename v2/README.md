Unlike omni v1, this iteration does not involve a mouthpiece. Instead, the joystick is placed in front of the lips using a flexible aluminum wire (attached to a headrest, armrest, or other part of wheelchair). This makes it convenient for the user to move the joystick in and out of the mouth. After consulting with need-knowers, we decided that this was a better approach.
